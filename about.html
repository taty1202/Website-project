            <h2 class="mb-4">Full-time dog mom and Front-End developer based in Seattle, WA</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">My name is Tatyana Araya and I live in Seattle, WA with my husband Matt and my dog Chip. I've worked for some awesome tech companies like Meta, Google and Tableau as a technical recruiter. Being exposed to some of the techncial work these companies worked on really made me want to learn and understand how to write code. I honestly didn't really know how to start so I looked for coding workshops/bootcamps that suited my schedule and SheCodes was it! I have learned throught this process and am excited to share some of the projects I was able to build during the workshops. While I'm not quite where I want to be yet, so stay tuned for more projects coming your way!</p>
